        "So far, we’ve explored the exciting world of Python programming and learned a lot of cool things! Here’s a quick summary of what we’ve covered:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Introduction to Python**\n",
        "   - **Class 1**: We started with the basics of programming and Python. We got familiar with Google Colab, learned how to use `print` statements, and understood the basic syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class 2**: We built on that by learning about functions like `len`, basic arithmetic operations, and variables. We also introduced control structures to guide how our code runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Class 3**: We explored the Math library, focusing on the `pi` function, and continued learning about variables and data types, particularly strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Class 4**: We revised strings, learned how to handle input and output, understood Boolean expressions, and worked with conditional statements (if, elif, else). We also emphasized the importance of code indentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Class 5**: We dove into loops, which help us repeat tasks automatically. We learned about two types of loops:\n",
        "   - **`while` Loop**: Keeps running as long as a condition is true.\n",
        "   - **`for` Loop**: Goes through a list or range of numbers and performs actions for each item.\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops are like magic spells that make repetitive tasks easier and faster, allowing us to focus on creating fun and useful programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Great job following along with these lessons! Keep practicing, and you’ll become even better at Python programming. Happy coding!"

        "\n",
        "1. **Main Game Loop**:\n",
        "   - The outer `while True` loop keeps the game running until the player decides to stop.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initial Choice**:\n",
        "   - The player chooses whether to enter the forest or go home.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Forest Path Loop**:\n",
        "   - Inside the forest, another loop handles the player's choice to go left or right.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Wolf Encounter Loop**:\n",
        "   - If the player goes left, they encounter a wolf. A loop handles their decision to fight or run.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Treasure Path**:\n",
        "   - If the player goes right, they find a treasure. This choice ends the forest path loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Replay Option**:\n",
        "   - After the game ends, the player is asked if they want to play again. If they choose \"no,\" the game exits; if they choose \"yes,\" the game restarts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: This version uses loops to manage different parts of the game, allowing the game to handle multiple choices and replay functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3: Run and Test\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the Python file to play the game. Test different choices to ensure that the game responds correctly to user input and that the story progresses as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 4: Extend the Game\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the game more fun and complex, you can:\n",
        "- Add more scenarios and choices.\n",
        "- Include items that players can collect.\n",
        "- Create different endings based on the choices.\n",
        "\n",
